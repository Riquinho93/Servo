         For all those who need extra income and are unemployed or employed, they can offer their technical training at Servo.
            Servo is a software that allows you to create a profile to disclose your technical background so that someone especially 
            from the neighborhood needs a professional of your qualification. The difference with this product is that you can 
            hire a good professional near you saving extra costs without having to hire a professional away from the workplace. Also,
            the product can help you if you move from city or neighborhood and need a professional such as a bricklayer, in which, 
            knowing nobody you can consult the Servo.
